# Knowledge Graph Construction with LLMs
## Overview

This repository contains a project developed as part of the Constructing Knowledge Graphs with LLMs course and the Generative AI Workshop from Neo4j GraphAcademy. The project demonstrates how to build a knowledge graph from PDF documents using Large Language Models (LLMs) and store it in a Neo4j graph database. It also includes topic extraction and validation using the Computer Science Ontology (CSO) and a chatbot interface built with Streamlit for querying and recommending papers.

## Prerequisites
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Neo4j Database**: A running Neo4j instance (local or cloud) with credentials configured.
- **Gemini API Key**: Obtain from [Google Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/) for Gemini-embedding-001 and Gemini-2.0-flash.
- **PDF Files**: Place computer science papers in `llm-knowledge-graph/data/pdfs`.

**Run Chatbot**:
   - Start the Streamlit application:
     `bash
     cd chatbot
     streamlit run main.py
     `
   - Open `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.
